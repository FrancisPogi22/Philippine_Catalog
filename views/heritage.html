                <h3>Banaue Rice Terraces - <span>Ifugao</span></h3>
                <p>
                  The Banaue Rice Terraces are called the 8th Wonder of the
                  Modern World by locals, these terraces are said to have been
                  carved into the mountains and hillsides by the ancestors of
                  the local indigenous Ifugao tribes, and are well over 2,000
                  years old. It’s also believed that these terraces were created
                  with little or no machinery and were carved mostly by hand.
                  They provide level steps in the sloped ground, allowing people
                  to plant and cultivate rice. Witness the awe-inspiring beauty
                  of the Banaue Rice Terraces, showcasing ancient agricultural
                  ingenuity.

                <p>
                  Siargao is an island of nine municipalities in the province of
                  Surigao del Norte. It is a teardrop-shaped island located on
                  the northeastern coast of Mindanao. Known as the “Surfing
                  Capital of the Philippines”. Siargao is mainly responsible for
                  introducing surfing to the country. Siargao offers everything
                  from crystal-clear waters, white sandy beaches, coconut palm
                  forests, and of course, world-class waves that make it a prime

                <p>
                  Known for its uniquely shaped group of hills, Chocolate Hills
                  offers an extraordinary landscape on the island of Bohol. With
                  an estimated 1,268 to 1,776 individual mounds, these
                  cone-shaped or dome-shaped hills are actually made of
                  grass-covered limestone. These unique hills get their name
                  from their brown color during the dry season, resembling rows
                  of delectable chocolate treats. It's a natural wonder you have
                  to see to believe, perfect for a scenic hike or simply soaking

                <h3>Intramuros – <span>Manila</span></h3>
                <p>
                  Intramuros, or the ‘Walled City’, is one of the oldest
                  districts of Manila. Intramuros is home to the city's iconic
                  and historic landmarks that have been built during the Spanish
                  occupation in the Philippines. It was built by the Spaniards –
                  more specifically by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi – and is bound on
                  all sides by moats and thick, high walls, some over 6 meters
                  high. Because of its old-world appeal, many locals and
                  foreigners frequent Intramuros to revisit the past and see
                  centuries-old establishments.
