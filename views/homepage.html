                <p>
                  The Banaue Rice Terraces are called the 8th Wonder of the
                  Modern World by locals, these terraces are said to have been
                  carved into the mountains and hillsides by the ancestors of
                  the local indigenous Ifugao tribes, and are well over 2,000
                  years old. It’s also believed that these terraces were created
                  with little or no machinery and were carved mostly by hand.
                  They provide level steps in the sloped ground, allowing people
                  to plant and cultivate rice. Witness the awe-inspiring beauty
                  of the Banaue Rice Terraces, showcasing ancient agricultural
                  ingenuity.
